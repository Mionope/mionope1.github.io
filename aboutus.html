        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            Cosmetics, Beauty Products, Skincare Products and Accessories  - we know these items are essential, and we also accept that they are expensive. We work hard, and we deserve to treat ourselves to these little luxuries, but doesn’t it dampen the mood when we see how much we are spending?

            Here at Cosmetic Capital, we decided that it was time to offer your favourite cosmetic items, but without the expensive burden that drains the fun out of any purchase!
            
            Your first question might be, How are you able to do this? At Cosmetic Capital, we use our unique relationships with cosmetic manufacturers, local distributors, overseas partners, clearance houses, and retail stores, to source the best deals on cosmetics that are available. We literally search the globe for the best deals around. We have forged these relationships over many years. We don’t like to boast, but we are the experts in finding great deals.
            
            We are often asked if our products are genuine, because they are so much cheaper than anywhere else. We guarantee that all our products are the genuine article. 
            
            Freight is free for orders over $70 for Australian customers, or there is an $8.95 flat rate shipping fee, regardless of how much you order, or how far away you live, for any order below $70 - Please note there are different shipping rates for international customers. We also endeavour to dispatch your order as soon as possible, normally within 48 hours from ordering.
            
            Need your order quickly? We also offer Express Shipping, for just $6.95 for any order over $70 of product value, or $10.95 otherwise.
            
            We are always bringing in new products from around the world, so come and see why we really are the Capital of Cosmetics! But don't just take our word for it. Read the thousands of five-star reviews from genuine customers here!
